# Data Processing Using Python

Training and testing data was processed using python by importing both .csv files as a dataframe. From there, [dataframe.drop()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) and [sklearn.scale()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.scale.html) were used to clean up the data. Missing columns or categorical data was also fixed using [dataframe.fill()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) and [dataframe.apply()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html). The resulting file was then written to .xlsx files and imported to Google Sheets for inspection, which they were then converted back to .csv and used as input data.

The file main.py contains various different models from Scikit's libraries and their performance with the Titanic Competition. Each model will have a respective output .csv file that was used to determine the model's test accuracy and performance in the Titanic Competition.
